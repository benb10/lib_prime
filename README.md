# lib_prime
Library functions related to prime numbers.

This is a collection of functions copied and modified from various sources.
The functions have proved useful for completing [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.

Some of the additions are:
- unit tests
- function contracts using [dpcontracts](https://github.com/deadpixi/contracts)
- property based tests using [hypothesis](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis)
